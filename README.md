# The Middlesex 20 Point Scale

Middlesex University (MDX) maintains a computer system for storing, converting and classifying student grades.
MDX does not use a percentage-scale for module grades. Instead it uses a 20-point scale that starts with 1 (a first-class result) down to 20 (failure by non-participation). Conversion from percentage-based grades to the 20-point scale is required in order to enter student grades into the MDX system.
